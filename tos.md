We refer to these two types of end users of the Services collectively as &quot;**Users**&quot; or &quot;**you**&quot; for purposes of these Terms. Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and OpenZeppelin and explain the rules governing use of the Services.

**8. Access to Services and Termination**

8.1 In order to register for and access Defender, you and each user will be required to provide information. You agree that any registration information given to OpenZeppelin, including contact information (e.g., e-mail address) and billing/payment details, will be accurate and kept current.

8.2 Defender includes the features and functionality applicable to the version selected. OpenZeppelin may update the content and functionality of Defender in its sole discretion. Some features and functionality may be available only with certain versions of Defender. OpenZeppelin does not represent or warrant that particular content, functionality, or subscription plans will be offered indefinitely and reserves the right to change or alter the features and options, including the right to put reasonable usage limitations on Defender, without prior notice. OpenZeppelin will use reasonable best efforts to provide advance notice of any such usage restrictions or any material change in offerings.

8.3 If you want to downgrade or terminate your subscription to Defender and close your account, you may do so at any time by (a) notifying customer support at least 10 business days in advance, or (b) cancelling your subscription in the account settings page, if this option is available to you. Paid Users will continue to have access to their paid tier of Defender through the end of any pre-paid and unused Subscription Terms. Paid Users will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been paid prior to account termination, including any amounts pre-paid for unused Subscription Terms.

8.4 OpenZeppelin may terminate your access to any Services, including Defender, immediately if: (a) you violate these Terms; (b) you cease business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings; or (c) it is required to do so by law.

8.5 OpenZeppelin may suspend your access to any Services, including Defender, immediately if: (a) you have undisputed amounts more than 5 days past due; (b) there is reason to believe that your use of Services is fraudulent or that you or any of your users are using the Services in a way that creates a security vulnerability or may disrupt others&#39; use of the Services; (c) there is scheduled or emergency maintenance; or (d) OpenZeppelin determines, in its sole discretion, that providing the Services is prohibited by applicable law, or it has become impractical or unfeasible for any legal or regulatory reason to the provide the Services.

**9. Billing, Payment and Renewal**

9.1 If you select a paid tier of Defender, OpenZeppelin will bill you in advance for use of the Services on a monthly basis. All paid subscription terms begin on the 1st day of the month and continue to the last day of the month (each, a &quot;**Subscription Term**&quot;). Your subscription will automatically renew on a monthly basis until terminated pursuant to these Terms.

9.2 If you select a paid tier of Defender in the middle of a calendar month, you may be given free access to such paid tier functionality prior to your first Subscription Term. Such early access is determined by OpenZeppelin at its sole discretion.

9.3 Current pricing for the paid tiers of Defender are published on the websites and/or within Defender. OpenZeppelin reserves the right to modify pricing at any time for renewal Subscription Terms, provided that OpenZeppelin will notify you prior to any price increase affecting your account. If you upgrade to a higher tier of paid account, OpenZeppelin will credit any remaining balance from your previous subscription payment to your new tier.

9.4 All payments due are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated on the account settings page, order or invoice. Credit card and debit card forms of payment are due 20 business days in advance of the next Subscription Term. Cryptocurrency forms of payment are due one month in advance of the next Subscription Term. For convenience, you may make pre-payment for future Subscription Terms. OpenZeppelin will charge you for all fees when due. OpenZeppelin may enable other forms of payment in the account billing page, which may be subject to additional terms.

**9.5 Your subscription will automatically renew on a monthly basis and you authorize OpenZeppelin to charge the credit card, debit card or other form of payment in advance for the next Subscription Term.** **All renewals are subject to the applicable Services continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates. If you wish to change your subscription tier, number of users, or other functionality you must change the settings in the account settings page provided in Defender, if available to you, or contact our customer support team at least 10 business days prior to the next Subscription Term. Any downgrade will take effect on the first day of the next Subscription Term.**

9.6 Billing disputes must be notified to OpenZeppelin in writing before the due date. Delinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys&#39; fees) incurred by OpenZeppelin in collecting delinquent amounts. If delinquent fees are not paid, OpenZeppelin will automatically downgrade your account to a free account and/or suspend or terminate your use of the Service. Downgrading your account may cause the loss of features, functionality or capacity. If you require a purchase order, vendor registration form, or other documentation, such requirement will in no way relieve, affect or delay your obligation to pay amounts when due.

9.7 You are responsible for any taxes, duties, and customs fees associated with the sale of the Services (other than OpenZeppelin&#39;s income tax) (collectively &quot;**Taxes**&quot;), and you will pay OpenZeppelin for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If OpenZeppelin is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide OpenZeppelin with a valid tax exemption certificate.

9.8 Except when required by law, all fees are non-cancellable and once paid are non-refundable, even in the case of unused paid Subscription Terms.

**10. Indemnification**

10.1 You agree to indemnify OpenZeppelin, its officers, directors and employees, from and against any liabilities, losses, damages and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees, associated with any claim or action of any kind whatsoever by a third party or User relating to or arising out of your use of the Services or inability to use the Services, your violation of any these Terms or your violation of any rights, including intellectual property rights, of a third party, or your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. OpenZeppelin reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with OpenZeppelin in asserting any available defenses.

#### 9. Access to Services and Termination

9.1 In order to register for and access Defender, you and each user will be required to provide information. You agree that any registration information given to OpenZeppelin, including contact information (e.g., identification, e-mail address, etc) and billing/payment details, will be accurate and kept current.  

9.2 Defender includes the features and functionality applicable to the version selected. OpenZeppelin may update the content and functionality of Defender, or any version thereof, in its sole discretion. Some features and functionality may be available only with certain versions of Defender. OpenZeppelin does not represent or warrant that particular content, functionality, or subscription plans will be offered indefinitely and reserves the right to change or alter the features and options, including the right to put reasonable usage limitations on Defender and respective versions, without prior notice. OpenZeppelin will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of any such usage restrictions or any material change in offerings.

9.3 If you want to downgrade or terminate your subscription to Defender and close your account, you may do so at any time by notifying support at least 20 business days in advance. Paid Users will continue to have access to their paid tier of Defender through the end of any pre-paid and unused Subscription Terms. Paid Users will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been paid prior to account termination, including any amounts pre-paid for unused Subscription Terms.

9.4 OpenZeppelin may terminate your access to any Services, including Defender, immediately if: (a) you violate these Terms; (b) you cease business operations or become subject to insolvency proceedings; or (c) it is required to do so by law. OpenZeppelin reserves the right to terminate Free Users' access to Defender without notice if your account goes unused for a period of 60 days or longer.

9.5 OpenZeppelin may suspend your access to any Services, including Defender, immediately if: (a) you have undisputed amounts more than 30 days past due; (b) there is reason to believe that your use of Services is fraudulent, or that you or any of your users are using the Services in a way that creates a security vulnerability or may disrupt others' use of the Services; (d) there is scheduled or emergency maintenance; or (e) OpenZeppelin determines, in its sole discretion, that providing the Services is prohibited by applicable law, or it has become impractical or unfeasible for any legal or regulatory reason to the provide the Services. 

#### 10. Billing, Payment and Renewal

10.1 If you select a paid tier of Defender, OpenZeppelin will bill you in advance for use of the Services on an annual basis. All paid subscription terms begin on the 1st day of the next month and continue for 12 months thereafter (each, a "**Subscription Term**"). Your subscription will automatically renew on an annual basis until terminated pursuant to these Terms.

10.2 If you select a paid tier of Defender in the middle of a calendar month, you may be given free access to such paid tier functionality prior to your first Subscription Term. Such early access will be determined by OpenZeppelin in its sole discretion and these Terms will apply to any such access.

10.3 Pricing for paid tiers of Defender will be quoted based on the features and functionality requested. OpenZeppelin reserves the right to modify pricing at any time for renewal Subscription Terms, provided that OpenZeppelin will notify you prior to any price increase affecting your account. If you upgrade to a higher tier of paid account, OpenZeppelin will credit any remaining balance from your previous subscription payment to your new tier.

10.4 All payments due are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated on the account settings page, order or invoice. Payments are due 20 business days in advance of the next Subscription Term.  OpenZeppelin will charge you for all fees when due. OpenZeppelin may enable other forms of payment in the account billing process, which may be subject to additional terms. For convenience, you may make pre-payment for future Subscription Terms.

**10.5 Your subscription will automatically renew on an annual basis and you authorize OpenZeppelin to charge the credit card, debit card or other form of payment in advance for the next Subscription Term.  All renewals are subject to the applicable Services continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates. If you wish to change your subscription tier or other functionality you must change the settings in the account settings page provided in Defender, if available to you, or contact our customer support team at least 20 business days prior to the next Subscription Term. Any downgrade will take effect on the first day of the next Subscription Term.**

10.6 Billing disputes must be notified to OpenZeppelin in writing before the due date. Delinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by OpenZeppelin in collecting delinquent amounts.  If delinquent fees are not paid, OpenZeppelin will automatically downgrade your account to a free account and/or suspend or terminate your use of the relevant Services. Downgrading your account may cause the loss of features, functionality or capacity and OpenZeppelin shall not be liable for any losses associated with downgrading or terminating your account. If you require a purchase order, vendor registration form, or other documentation, such requirement will in no way relieve, affect or delay your obligation to pay amounts when due.

10.7 You are responsible for any taxes, duties, and customs fees associated with the sale of the Services (other than OpenZeppelin's income tax) (collectively "**Taxes**"), and you will pay OpenZeppelin for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If OpenZeppelin is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide OpenZeppelin with a valid tax exemption certificate.

10.8 Except when required by law, all fees are non-cancellable and once paid are non-refundable, even in the case of unused paid Subscription Terms.

#### 11. Indemnification

11.1 You agree to indemnify OpenZeppelin, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any liabilities, losses, damages and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, associated with any claim or action of any kind whatsoever by a third party or User relating to or arising out of your use of the Services or inability to use the Services, your violation of any these Terms or your violation of any rights, including intellectual property rights, of a third party, or your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. OpenZeppelin reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with OpenZeppelin in asserting any available defenses.

#### 12. Disclaimer of Certain Liabilities

BECAUSE SOME STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SERVICES.
